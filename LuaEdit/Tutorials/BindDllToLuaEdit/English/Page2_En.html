							Before you start programming logics of the Simon<sup>®</sup> game, there are actually some basics
							code setups to do just like in any other script. Let's start by adding the following
							variables at the begenning of script:

						  	These variables will actually be used as if they were constants since the concept
							of constants does not really exist in Lua. This means that our code should never
							modify their content. Next, we will add four "actual" variables (their content will
							probably change during the execution of the script) to control the game's environment:

						  	The GameState variable is a boolean which is worth false if the game is over or true if not. MainSequence is
							a table wich contains the whole sequence since the beginning of the new game. The variable SequenceCount is
							an integer containing the actual total sequence's length. Finally, UserSequenceCount is an integer
							containing the user's sequence length so far. Next, we will need to add four functions in wich we will add
							some code later. Those functions will be nested into the the table simon which will be created by the game
							engine (simon.dll) when the script will initialize through the Initializer function:

						  	The OnClick(ButtonIndex) function will be called every time the user
							will click on a button. In this function we will validate the clicked
							button in the current sequence.	The functions simon:AddSequence(Sequence), 
							simon:PlaySequence(Sequence) and simon:Initialize() are functions that are going
							to be called by our own script to handle different steps during the game.
							One last thing remains before the end of this step: creating the game's
							frame. To do so, a main loop at the end of the script will be required as
							follows:

						  	This loop will handle the game from the beginning to the end. An iteration
							in this loop will be executed many times per second when there is no need for
							it. That's why the game engine (simon.dll) has exported a function called Sleep()
							which tells the processor to sleep for a certain amount of time in miliseconds.
							In other words, by using this function we will ensure that the game isn't using 100% of the processor's resources
							since we don't need it in this particular case.	Also, as you probably noticed already, 
							this code snippet includes two function calls from the game engine: simon.Create() and
							simon.Destroy(). The simon.Create() function create the Simon<sup>®</sup> game interface to interact
							with the user when the simon.Destroy() function destroys this interface. In the next step, we
							will add some code into the previously added functions.

							<b>Hints:</b>
							<ul type="square">						 
								<li>The reserved word "local" used in the variables declarations code above is not
									necessary for the code to work since this script isn't supposed to be loaded
									in any other scripts. On the other hand, since these variables are going to be
									used ONLY in the script's global scope, it would be recommended, to avoid any
									potential problems, to keep the "local" instruction even if not necessary. See
									section 2.6 of Lua 5.0 documentation for more details. (Available in LuaEdit
									Help menu)</li>
								<li>The Create() function has an optional argument you can pass to. This argument
									manages how the interface will be created. When this argument is worth 1, it creates
									the interface in a sizeable regular window. When it's worth 2, it creates the
									interface in a sizeable tool window. When the argument is worth anything else
									than 1 or 2, it creates the interface without any borders. In our example, this
									optional argument was worth nil since we didn't give any to this function call.</li>
