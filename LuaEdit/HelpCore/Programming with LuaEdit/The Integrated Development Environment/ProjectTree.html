						  	 The "Project Tree" is one of the most important window in LuaEdit. It provides a summary of all the files
							 currently in edition in LuaEdit and is an efficient way to manage your LuaEdit projects. From the "Project Tree"
							 window you can perform the following actions:
							 <br>
							 <br>
							 <br>
							 <b>Activate Selected Project</b><br>
							 Since LuaEdit can handle more than one project file at once, you must specify to LuaEdit on which project the "project
							 related" actions will be performed or from wich project some information will be used by LuaEdit. For example, just before
							 running a script, LuaEdit will attempt to link to a dll. This feature is called the Initializer and can only be specified
							 through a project's settings. In such case, LuaEdit will use the currently "Activated" project to know where to get such
							 setting.
							 <br>
							 <br>
							 <b>Unload Loaded Files</b><br>
							 All files opened with LuaEdit are automatically displayed in the "Project Tree" window. You can unload
							 them from LuaEdit's memory by right clicking on the file and click on the "Unload File/Project" contextual
							 menu item.
							 <br>
							 <br>
							 <b>Find the Target of a File</b><br>
							 This action will hlep you find the actual source of the file on your hard drive by opening through windows explorer
							 the folder where it is located.
							 <br>
							 <br>
							 <b>Add a File to a Project</b><br>
							 In order for projects to be useful, we need to be able to add files in them. This is why this action is available to you.
							 Another window should be displayed asking you to open existing file(s) or add a new one.
							 <br>
							 <br>
							 <b>Add a File to a Project</b><br>
							 This action will remove the selected file from the project it is associated with.
