						  	  This version of LuaEdit includes major and minor bug fixes. LuaEdit is now faster and more
							  efficient than ever. Also, some features have been upgraded for more conviviality when others
							  are completely new to serve better the programmer's needs. Here is a detailed listing of the
							  changes brought in this version:
						  </p>
						  <ul type="square"> 
						  	  <li>Major bug fix in the debug engine: A CPU Sleep instruction was called on every debug
							      hook call wich was dramatically slowing down the code execution when running under LuaEdit.</li>
							  <li>Major bug fix in the debug engine: When the unit is new, an extra call to ExpandUNCFileName 
							  	  was done wich was trowing an exeception.</li>
							  <li>Minor bug fix in the tab control server: If prompted to save before closing a new unit, a save dialog was shown
							      because the unit is new and an initial path is required to be specified by the user. Pressing the cancel button
								  of that dialog was not really cancelling the action.</li>
							  <li>Minor bug fix in the menus, submenus, popup menus and toolbars icons: The white pixels of the icons were treated and
							      displayed as if they were transparent.</li>
							  <li>Minor bug fix in the "Fucntion List" window: Sometimes this window wasn't automatically updating when switching from
							  	  a unit to another.</li>
							  <li>Changed the look of the status bar by handling a custom draw to make it look more like .Net style.</li>
							  <li>Updated help files.</li>
							  <li>Changed the "Project Tree" window into a new merge of a listview and a treeview into the same component</li>
							  <li>Changed the "Watch" window into a new merge of a listview and a treeview into the same component. This now
							      allow the user to better visualize variables, tables and sub-tables.</li>
							  <li>New LuaEditDebug.dll file for embedded lua code debugging from user's applications. (Special thanks to Massimo Magnano)
							  <li>New library engine for completion proposal (not hardcoded anymore) including a new section in the
							      editor settings: "Environment".</li>			   		
							  <li>New powerful "Find in Files" engine.</li>
							  <li>New "Find Window 1" and "Find Window 2" windows to output the "Find in Files" results.</li>
							  <li>New IE "Internal Browser" to allow browsing the internet inside the IDE.</li>
							  <li>New "History" ring for the new "Internal Browser"</li>
							  <li>New Comment/Uncomment, Uppercase/Lowercase selection commands</li>
							  <li>New "Goto Last Edited" action to send the cursor back to the last edited line.</li>
							  <li>Drag and drop *.lpr or *.lua files from Windows<sup>®</sup> into LuaEdit is now supported.
							      This means that LuaEdit is opening the dropped files if they have the *.lpr or *.lua extension.</li>
