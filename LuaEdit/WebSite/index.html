								The 2.5 version of LuaEdit includes major bug fixes. Most likely, the bugs were related to CPU utilizations
								and display problems. Some known bugs are still known and not fixed such as assigning a table to itself.
								(EG: "c = _G" or "c = {}; c[1] = c")
								<br>
								<br>
								Some news concerning development of remote debugging: the feature is on its way. We know that many of you are
								waiting after this to come in LuaEdit. Right now, rough interfaces are already implemented. It is now a questions
								of days or mounths, depending on how demanding will be our real jobs. ;) Also, some speculations are running about
								an eventual "Visual" version of LuaEdit with wxLua. (nothing concrete yet) Feel free to discuss about those future
								development in our <a href="http://luaforge.net/forum/?group_id=84">forums</a>.

								Another important detail: If you used the previous 2.2 version of LuaEdit you should go in the editor settings and reset

								LuaEdit has just reached the Top 10 most downloaded software on LuaForge! First of all, the LuaEdit team would like to thank those of you who downloaded
								the software. Thank you very much for trusting and using LuaEdit for Lua development. Outrageous numbers of hours have been implied
								in the success of LuaEdit and this is the best "Thank You" we could ever get. The development of LuaEdit will continue as long as the demand will grow for an efficient IDE for
								the Lua language, to serve the needs of all the Lua community. Special thanks also for those who worked long hours to bring LuaEdit to
								such a wonderful success. To celebrate this great event, here is a short summary of the project	and some up and coming features: November 13th 2004, 
								LuaEdit was created under the version 1.0 on LuaForge making the first
								official IDE specifilized for Lua. By the end of December 2004, LuaEdit was already downloaded by over 150 people and its offcial website
								was already visited by over 1500 poeple. By the beginning of April 2005, LuaEdit source code was finally available through CVS to
								accommodate developers' needs. On April 24th 2005, the 2.0 version of LuaEdit was released. Major changes from the first version
								and bug fixes were released in this version. Today, LuaEdit has been downloaded over 700 times and more than 5500 people have
								visited the offcial website putting LuaEdit in 4th position for most visited website and 10th position for most downloaded software
								on LuaForge. For the next version of LuaEdit, new important features should be available such as embedded Lua code debugging, 
								remote debugging and multilingual support. Once again, thank you very much for using LuaEdit!

								LuaEdit sources are finally on CVS. This means that anyone can now obtain the lastest sources
								currently in development. We figured that releasing the sources on CVS would be a great advancement
								and a good security for development. The cvs server of luaforge is cvs.luafoge.net and there are
								three modules to checkout in order to obtain all the sources. The first one is the LuaEdit module wich 
								contains direct sources for the IDE. The second module is the "Component" one. It contains files of all
								external components used by the luaedit project. Finally, the "ReadMe" module contains information on how
								to get this project to compile on your own PC. You may have a look at this CVS content using the
