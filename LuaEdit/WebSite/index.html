								The LuaEdit team is reporting to you to give you updates on the development of the 3.0 version of
								LuaEdit. Some major new features are on their way! To begin with, all (at least
								most of them) will be revised and tested to make this version as "bug-free" as it can be. We will
								put all are efforts toward bug hunting since this is a crucial aspect of a good software. Also, some
								Major (notice the capital "M") code reorganization in our code classes were made to provide more
								flexibility to the IDE such as the ability to open more than just *.lua and *.lpr files. This will also
								help to minimize the number of bugs.
								<br><br>
								We also want to announce that this next version will provide full support of Lua 5.1 leaving behind all
								version 2.x for Lua 5.0 debugging. This had to be done someday and we figured this next major version was
								the proper time to do it. This Lua 5.1 compatibility is partly due thanks to <a href="http://luaforge.net/users/kawageo/">Geo Massar</a>
								a good contact of mine and proud contributor to the LuaForge with his new project <a href="http://luaforge.net/projects/luatut/">LuaScene</a>
								, a great Lua binding to Open GL libraries.
								<br><br>
								Also, a new "Lua Macro" feature has been add to the IDE. This, in other words, is a way to provide easy and quick
								user custom tools for LuaEdit. Creating macros will add menus in LuaEdit's interface that can be used by the users.
								These "Lua Macro" are actually Lua files that will be executed on the click event of these custom menus and just
								before execution, LuaEdit register its functionalities in a "luaedit" Lua table. This will come with heavy documentation
								known as LuaEdit SDK. Tool programmers: get ready!
								<br><br>
								A new experimental GUI building engine will also be provided in this version. Two major goals: Provide an easy and
								reliable way of making advance UI input for the "Lua Macro" features and eventually, support one of the many stable GUI
								Lua binding (EG: IUP, NGUI, wxLua).
								<br><br>
								The current website will also be updated soon with a fresh and unique interface thanks to a good friend
								of mine (and now new LuaEdit's webmaster) <a href="http://luaforge.net/users/ti133700n/">David Corriveau St-Louis</a>.
								<br><br>
								Now these will be the major updates in this next version of LuaEdit with a plenty of other small to medium
								changes and/or new features. We plan this new release for LuaEdit's 2nd year of annversary on this
								upcoming november 13th 2006. If, by any chances, you would like to suggest or comment this next version before
								its release, please do so by using our <a href="http://luaforge.net/forum/?group_id=84">forum</a>. Your
								feedbacks are very important for the future of the project. Thanks to all of you for supporting LuaEdit!

								LuaEdit version 3.0.2a has just been released! Some major bugs were fixed in that version including
								the infinite sub-table reference one. Also, new features like a whole new Lua profiler and support

								LuaEdit version 3.0.1a has just been released! Many features and bug fixes are included
								in this new version. Also, as you probably noticed by now, some of the graphics were
								changed. Most of the interface has been kept the way it was besides the Editor Settings
								and the Project Settings windows. For a more detailed list of the changes, please consult
								our <a href="History.html">project history</a> page. This release is the alpha version of
								LuaEdit's newest major revision. We've decided this mostly because of the new remote
								debugging feature that should be operational in in the beta or official release of this major
								revision. (So this feature is still not completed, even though it's partialy part of the interface,
								but it's on its way...) Keep in mind that this is an alpha version and that many other features and
								bug fixes will be added to the official release. New feature requests at this point of the developpement
								are still welcome for those interested. Simply add a feature request post in our
								<a href="http://luaforge.net/tracker/?group_id=84">trackers</a>. We still recommend the version 2.5 for
								stable Lua developpement. Enjoy!

								and display problems. Some known bugs are still known and not fixed such as assigning a table to itself.
								(EG: "c = _G" or "c = {}; c[1] = c")

								LuaEdit has just reached the Top 10 most downloaded software on LuaForge! First of all, the LuaEdit team would like to thank those of you who downloaded
								the software. Thank you very much for trusting and using LuaEdit for Lua development. Outrageous numbers of hours have been implied
								in the success of LuaEdit and this is the best "Thank You" we could ever get. The development of LuaEdit will continue as long as the demand will grow for an efficient IDE for
								the Lua language, to serve the needs of all the Lua community. Special thanks also for those who worked long hours to bring LuaEdit to
								such a wonderful success. To celebrate this great event, here is a short summary of the project	and some up and coming features: November 13th 2004, 
								LuaEdit was created under the version 1.0 on LuaForge making the first
								official IDE specifilized for Lua. By the end of December 2004, LuaEdit was already downloaded by over 150 people and its offcial website
								was already visited by over 1500 poeple. By the beginning of April 2005, LuaEdit source code was finally available through CVS to
								accommodate developers' needs. On April 24th 2005, the 2.0 version of LuaEdit was released. Major changes from the first version
								and bug fixes were released in this version. Today, LuaEdit has been downloaded over 700 times and more than 5500 people have
								visited the offcial website putting LuaEdit in 4th position for most visited website and 10th position for most downloaded software
								on LuaForge. For the next version of LuaEdit, new important features should be available such as embedded Lua code debugging, 
								remote debugging and multilingual support. Once again, thank you very much for using LuaEdit!
